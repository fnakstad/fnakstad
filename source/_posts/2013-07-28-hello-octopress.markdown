I have been working on migrating my blog from Wordpress to Octopress lately, and finally the new version is live!
The new setup is running via [nginx](http://nginx.org/) on an Ubuntu VPS from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/).
This was my first time trying out nginx, and it was surprisingly simple to set up! 
I guess it's used more often as a reverse proxy, but for static sites (such as Octopress) it also works really well as a simple server.

Another reason for the lack of posts lately is that I am moving to Tokyo this September to start studying at [Waseda University](http://www.waseda.jp/).
I'll be starting my Master's studies there as part of [Professor Washizaki's lab](http://www.washi.cs.waseda.ac.jp/), and I couldn't be more excited about it!
Needless to say, moving to the other side of the world encompasses a ton of preparations and paperwork (and the Japanese, like any other bureaucracy I guess, *love* their paperwork).

So, hopefully there will be more non-technical posts as well.
However, I have a half-finished post I'll publish quite soon, which will complement [Authentication in Single Page Applications With Angular.js](http://www.frederiknakstad.com/authentication-in-single-page-applications-with-angular-js/) with information about how the server-side is set up. I've received a lot of questions about that, so I thought a clarification might be in order.
